# Genshin Music Classifier

This is a project to classify music from different regions in the video game
Genshin Impact.

Special thanks to the Sound of AI Youtube channel
(https://www.youtube.com/@ValerioVelardoTheSoundofAI) 
for providing the background knowledge necessary for this project. In
particular, the two courses I learned from were:

- Audio Signal Processing for Machine Learning

- Deep Learning (for Audio) with Python
